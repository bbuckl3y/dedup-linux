# dedup-linux
code to find duplicate files in a directory hierarchy.

The code is in Python 3.

The initial version will work on image files.

I expect later that it will remove the duplicates - and link the names of duplicate files to the same file.
It may also put the files in a date-based directory hierarchy based on the original image creation date in the file (if this is possibel).
